# ROADMAP
- [ ] Basic UI: 
    - [x] Image picker
    - [x] Generate caption button
    - [ ] Better spacing
- [ ] Handle ML output logic from CoreML model
- [ ] Machine Learning experiments:
    - [ ] Experiment with different models: VGG, ResNet, CNN, RNN, LSTM, Transformer
    - [ ] Pytorch vs Keras/Tensorflow 
- [ ] Convert final Python model into CoreML model
- [ ] Integrate converted CoreML model into app
